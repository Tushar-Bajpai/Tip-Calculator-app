## 📄 About The Project

This is a solution to the [Tip Calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). The goal was to build a fully functional tip calculator that updates in real-time.

**Users can:**
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size (Responsive Design).
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person.
- Enter a custom percentage for the tip.
- Reset the calculator with a single click.
